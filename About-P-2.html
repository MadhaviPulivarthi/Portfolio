    <p class="About">Hello, I'm Pulivarthi Madhavi, a recent graduate from Krishna University with a BSc in Computer Science. My journey in the world of technology has been driven by a passion for innovation and a deep-seated desire to make a positive impact. One of my most significant achievements is my project titled "MACHINE LEARNING based approaches for detecting COVID-19 using clinical text data." This project reflects my dedication to harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to combat real-world challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond academics, I find solace in reading books to expand my horizons, immersing myself in music, and enjoying indoor games that keep my mind sharp. With a certification in Java Full Stack Development and a skill set that includes Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, and SQL, I'm equipped to tackle complex problems and turn ideas into reality. My mission is to explore new opportunities, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape. Feel free to explore my portfolio, and let's connect to explore the possibilities of working together to shape a better future through technology.</p>
